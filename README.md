# WordSearch
This is a wordsearch using Java. I did a project similar to but in the terminal and I wanted to fulfill my dream of making it in a GUI

# Features
- **1 Player and 2 Player Mode** Allowing two people in the same room to play together in a competitive setting!
- **Hints** A maximum of 3 hints per person, which deducts points but gives the beginning of each word increasing words when asking more hints
- **Buttons** Buttons are made throughout the board with char letters so that you can guess

# Old Version
- **I did this during AP Java:** https://github.com/Is0toi/String-Project/tree/main
