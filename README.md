# WordSearch
This is a wordsearch using Java. I did a project similar to but in the terminal and I wanted to fulfill my dream of making it in a GUI

# Rules
-- **Single Player**
1. There is a set of folders that contain 4 letter words and 5 letter words that are common
2. The board will scramble (2) 4 letter words and (3) 5 letter words
3. The user is allowed 4 hints but it deducts 5 points (Since it reveals both the (2) four letter words avaliable)
4. User can quit whenever

-- **Multiplayer**
1. Two people have to share the same computer in order to play the game
2. The player 1 will input 5 words relating to a theme that they decide and the board will scramble the words in a 15x15 grid
3. Player 2 will have to guess where all the words are and vice versa
4. You are only allowed 3 hints but they deduct only 3 points off
5. User can quit whenever

# Features
- **1 Player and 2 Player Mode** Allowing two people in the same room to play together in a competitive setting!
- **Hints** A maximum of 3 hints per person, which deducts points but gives the beginning of each word increasing words when asking more hints
- **Buttons** Buttons are made throughout the board with char letters so that you can guess

# Old Version
- **I did this during AP Java:** https://github.com/Is0toi/String-Project/tree/main
